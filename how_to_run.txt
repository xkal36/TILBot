First, a few external modules must be installed: praw, django and requests. If they are not already installed, simply run:

pip install praw

pip install django

and

pip install requests

in the terminal. Note: easy_install may also be used.

Make sure all the files are in the same directory and that the current working directory is set to that directory. Then, all you
need to do is run the fact_sender.py file, as follows:

python fact_sender.py

The program will run and instructions on how to use program will appear in the terminal.
